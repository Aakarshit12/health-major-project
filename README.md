# Health Major Project

Health Major Project is a digital platform focused on monitoring, recording, and analyzing personal health information. The system is designed as an academic and practical implementation that demonstrates full‑stack development, data handling, and extensible healthcare features.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Managing health data manually is inefficient and error‑prone. This project provides a centralized system where users can store medical or daily wellness information, observe patterns, and build smarter health awareness through structured records.

---

## ✨ Core Features

* User registration and authentication
* Add, update, and delete health records
* View historical data
* Dashboard for understanding trends
* Modular design for adding AI or analytics later
